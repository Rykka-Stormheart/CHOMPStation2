/*
 * The purpose of this file is to host custom NPCs for use in your ships!
 * Whether you want a pilot that looks different from a standard one, would prefer a wolf-like canid versus a feline, etc...
 * Use this file for such. Please ensure that your distress NPC uses an AI subtype from ship_npcs.dm - All available AI types will be listed below.
 * If you're new and reading this, copy-paste the example, MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE FACTION AND NAME VAR, and then select an AI based on the list provided.
 * Further information TBD based on first-tests.
